# Barry Hodler  

Barry Hodler is a crypo bro agent that evolves on chain to invest, hodl and trade crypto.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run dev
```


# Project Structure

The folder structure has to grow organically and quite predictably so that we can even let the agent generate it's own code in the future. ðŸ¤¯

To do:

- [ ] set up bun tests
- [ ] work on new transports: twitter? discord? etc?
- [ ] wire fully a first tool to be executed and ran. (hyperfolic renting a GPU first TODO: @guibibeau)
